                      Member States shall identify the location and boundaries of bodies of surface water and shall carry out an
                      initial characterisation of all such bodies in accordance with the following methodology. Member States may
                      group surface water bodies together for the purposes of this initial characterisation.

                      (i) The surface water bodies within the river basin district shall be identified as falling within either one of the
                          following surface water categories  rivers, lakes, transitional waters or coastal waters  or as artificial
                          surface water bodies or heavily modified surface water bodies.

                      (ii) For each surface water category, the relevant surface water bodies within the river basin district shall be
                           differentiated according to type. These types are those defined using either system A or system B
                           identified in section 1.2.

                      (iii) If system A is used, the surface water bodies within the river basin district shall first be differentiated by
                            the relevant ecoregions in accordance with the geographical areas identified in section 1.2 and shown on
                            the relevant map in Annex XI. The water bodies within each ecoregion shall then be differentiated by
                            surface water body types according to the descriptors set out in the tables for system A.

                      (iv) If system B is used, Member States must achieve at least the same degree of differentiation as would be
                           achieved using system A. Accordingly, the surface water bodies within the river basin district shall be
                           differentiated into types using the values for the obligatory descriptors and such optional descriptors, or
                           combinations of descriptors, as are required to ensure that type specific biological reference conditions can
                           be reliably derived.

                      (v) For artificial and heavily modified surface water bodies the differentiation shall be undertaken in
                          accordance with the descriptors for whichever of the surface water categories most closely resembles the
                          heavily modified or artificial water body concerned.

                      (vi) Member States shall submit to the Commission a map or maps (in a GIS format) of the geographical
                           location of the types consistent with the degree of differentiation required under system A.

             1.3.   Establishment of type-specific reference conditions for surface water body types



                    (i) For each surface water body type characterised in accordance with section 1.1, type-specific
                        hydromorphological and physicochemical conditions shall be established representing the values of the
                        hydromorphological and physicochemical quality elements specified in point 1.1 in Annex V for that
                        surface water body type at high ecological status as defined in the relevant table in point 1.2 in Annex V.
                        Type-specific biological reference conditions shall be established, representing the values of the biological
                        quality elements specified in point 1.1 in Annex V for that surface water body type at high ecological
                        status as defined in the relevant table in section 1.2 in Annex V.



                    (ii) In applying the procedures set out in this section to heavily modified or artificial surface water bodies
                         references to high ecological status shall be construed as references to maximum ecological potential as
                         defined in table 1.2.5 of Annex V. The values for maximum ecological potential for a water body shall be
                         reviewed every six years.



                    (iii) Type-specific conditions for the purposes of points (i) and (ii) and type-specific biological reference
                          conditions may be either spatially based or based on modelling, or may be derived using a combination of
                          these methods. Where it is not possible to use these methods, Member States may use expert judgement to
                          establish such conditions. In defining high ecological status in respect of concentrations of specific
                          synthetic pollutants, the detection limits are those which can be achieved in accordance with the available
                          techniques at the time when the type-specific conditions are to be established.



                    (iv) For spatially based type-specific biological reference conditions, Member States shall develop a reference
                         network for each surface water body type. The network shall contain a sufficient number of sites of high
                         status to provide a sufficient level of confidence about the values for the reference conditions, given the
                         variability in the values of the quality elements corresponding to high ecological status for that surface
                         water body type and the modelling techniques which are to be applied under paragraph (v).



                    (v) Type-specific biological reference conditions based on modelling may be derived using either predictive
                        models or hindcasting methods. The methods shall use historical, palaeological and other available data
                        and shall provide a sufficient level of confidence about the values for the reference conditions to ensure
                        that the conditions so derived are consistent and valid for each surface water body type.

                   (vi) Where it is not possible to establish reliable type-specific reference conditions for a quality element in a
                        surface water body type due to high degrees of natural variability in that element, not just as a result of
                        seasonal variations, then that element may be excluded from the assessment of ecological status for that
                        surface water type. In such circumstances Member States shall state the reasons for this exclusion in the
                        river basin management plan.



           1.4.    Identification of Pressures

                   Member States shall collect and maintain information on the type and magnitude of the significant
                   anthropogenic pressures to which the surface water bodies in each river basin district are liable to be subject,

                   (iv) Directives 75/440/EC, 76/160/EEC (2), 78/659/EEC and 79/923/EEC (3).

                   Estimation and identification of significant diffuse source pollution, in particular by substances listed in
                   Annex VIII, from urban, industrial, agricultural and other installations and activities; based, inter alia, on
                   information gathered under:

                   (i) Articles 3, 5 and 6 of Directive 91/676/EEC (4);

                   (ii) Articles 7 and 17 of Directive 91/414/EEC;

                   (iii) Directive 98/8/EC;

                   and for the purposes of the first river basin management plan:

                   (iv) Directives 75/440/EEC, 76/160/EEC, 76/464/EEC, 78/659/EEC and 79/923/EEC.

                   Estimation and identification of significant water abstraction for urban, industrial, agricultural and other uses,
                   including seasonal variations and total annual demand, and of loss of water in distribution systems.

                   Estimation and identification of the impact of significant water flow regulation, including water transfer and
                   diversion, on overall flow characteristics and water balances.

                   Identification of significant morphological alterations to water bodies.

                   Estimation and identification of other significant anthropogenic impacts on the status of surface waters.

                   where relevant, fisheries and forests.



           1.5.    Assessment of Impact

                   Member States shall carry out an assessment of the susceptibility of the surface water status of bodies to the
                   pressures identified above.

                    Member States shall use the information collected above, and any other relevant information including existing
                    environmental monitoring data, to carry out an assessment of the likelihood that surface waters bodies within
                    the river basin district will fail to meet the environmental quality objectives set for the bodies under Article 4.
                    Member States may utilise modelling techniques to assist in such an assessment.


                    For those bodies identified as being at risk of failing the environmental quality objectives, further
                    characterisation shall, where relevant, be carried out to optimise the design of both the monitoring
                    programmes required under Article 8, and the programmes of measures required under Article 11.




             2.     GROUNDWATERS



             2.1.   Initial characterisation


                    Member States shall carry out an initial characterisation of all groundwater bodies to assess their uses and the
                    degree to which they are at risk of failing to meet the objectives for each groundwater body under Article 4.
                    Member States may group groundwater bodies together for the purposes of this initial characterisation. This
                    analysis may employ existing hydrological, geological, pedological, land use, discharge, abstraction and other
                    data but shall identify:

                     the location and boundaries of the groundwater body or bodies,

                     the pressures to which the groundwater body or bodies are liable to be subject including:

                          diffuse sources of pollution

                          point sources of pollution

                          abstraction

                          artificial recharge,

                     the general character of the overlying strata in the catchment area from which the groundwater body
                      receives its recharge,

                     those groundwater bodies for which there are directly dependent surface water ecosystems or terrestrial
                      ecosystems.



             2.2.   Further characterisation


                    Following this initial characterisation, Member States shall carry out further characterisation of those
                    groundwater bodies or groups of bodies which have been identified as being at risk in order to establish a
                    more precise assessment of the significance of such risk and identification of any measures to be required
                    under Article 11. Accordingly, this characterisation shall include relevant information on the impact of human
                    activity and, where relevant, information on:

                     geological characteristics of the groundwater body including the extent and type of geological units,

                     hydrogeological characteristics of the groundwater body including hydraulic conductivity, porosity and
                      confinement,

                     characteristics of the superficial deposits and soils in the catchment from which the groundwater body
                      receives its recharge, including the thickness, porosity, hydraulic conductivity, and absorptive properties of
                      the deposits and soils,

                     stratification characteristics of the groundwater within the groundwater body,

                     an inventory of associated surface systems, including terrestrial ecosystems and bodies of surface water,
                      with which the groundwater body is dynamically linked,

                   estimates of the directions and rates of exchange of water between the groundwater body and associated
                    surface systems,

                   sufficient data to calculate the long term annual average rate of overall recharge,

                    contributions from human activity. Member States may use typologies for groundwater characterisation
                    when establishing natural background levels for these bodies of groundwater.


           2.3.   Review of the impact of human activity on groundwaters

                  For those bodies of groundwater which cross the boundary between two or more Member States or are
                  identified following the initial characterisation undertaken in accordance with paragraph 2.1 as being at risk of
                  failing to meet the objectives set for each body under Article 4, the following information shall, where relevant,
                  be collected and maintained for each groundwater body:

                  (a) the location of points in the groundwater body used for the abstraction of water with the exception of:

                        points for the abstraction of water providing less than an average of 10 m3 per day, or,

                        points for the abstraction of water intended for human consumption providing less than an average of
                         10 m3 per day or serving less than 50 persons,

                  (b) the annual average rates of abstraction from such points,

                  (c) the chemical composition of water abstracted from the groundwater body,

                  (d) the location of points in the groundwater body into which water is directly discharged,

                  (e) the rates of discharge at such points,

                  (f) the chemical composition of discharges to the groundwater body, and

                  (g) land use in the catchment or catchments from which the groundwater body receives its recharge, including
                      pollutant inputs and anthropogenic alterations to the recharge characteristics such as rainwater and run-off
                      diversion through land sealing, artificial recharge, damming or drainage.


           2.4.   Review of the impact of changes in groundwater levels

                  Member States shall also identify those bodies of groundwater for which lower objectives are to be specified
                  under Article 4 including as a result of consideration of the effects of the status of the body on:

                  (i) surface water and associated terrestrial ecosystems

                  (ii) water regulation, flood protection and land drainage

                  (iii) human development.


           2.5.   Review of the impact of pollution on groundwater quality

                  Member States shall identify those bodies of groundwater for which lower objectives are to be specified under
                  Article 4(5) where, as a result of the impact of human activity, as determined in accordance with Article 5(1),
                  the body of groundwater is so polluted that achieving good groundwater chemical status is infeasible or
                  disproportionately expensive.

           1.2.6.   Procedure for the setting of chemical quality standards by Member States



                    In deriving environmental quality standards for pollutants listed in points 1 to 9 of Annex VIII for the
                    protection of aquatic biota, Member States shall act in accordance with the following provisions. Standards
                    may be set for water, sediment or biota.



                    Where possible, both acute and chronic data shall be obtained for the taxa set out below which are relevant
                    for the water body type concerned as well as any other aquatic taxa for which data are available. The base set
                    of taxa are:


                     algae and/or macrophytes


                     daphnia or representative organisms for saline waters


                     fish.




                    Setting the environmental quality standard



                    The following procedure applies to the setting of a maximum annual average concentration:


                    (i) Member States shall set appropriate safety factors in each case consistent with the nature and quality of
                        the available data and the guidance given in section 3.3.1 of Part II of Technical guidance document in
                        support of Commission Directive 93/67/EEC on risk assessment for new notified substances and
                        Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 on risk assessment for existing substances and the safety factors
                        set out in the table below:

                         Two chronic NOECs from species representing two trophic levels (fish and/or
                         daphnia or a representative organism for saline waters and/or algae)              50


                         Chronic NOECs from at least three species (normally fish, daphnia or a
                         representative organism for saline waters and algae) representing three trophic
                         levels                                                                            10

                         precise safety factors to be calculated and applied                               Case-by-case assessment



                    (ii) where data on persistence and bioaccumulation are available, these shall be taken into account in deriving
                         the final value of the environmental quality standard;


                    (iii) the standard thus derived should be compared with any evidence from field studies. Where anomalies
                          appear, the derivation shall be reviewed to allow a more precise safety factor to be calculated;


                    (iv) the standard derived shall be subject to peer review and public consultation including to allow a more
                         precise safety factor to be calculated.

             1.3.     Monitoring of ecological status and chemical status for surface waters


                      The surface water monitoring network shall be established in accordance with the requirements of Article 8.
                      The monitoring network shall be designed so as to provide a coherent and comprehensive overview of
                      ecological and chemical status within each river basin and shall permit classification of water bodies into five
                      classes consistent with the normative definitions in section 1.2. Member States shall provide a map or maps
                      showing the surface water monitoring network in the river basin management plan.


                      On the basis of the characterisation and impact assessment carried out in accordance with Article 5 and
                      Annex II, Member States shall for each period to which a river basin management plan applies, establish a
                      surveillance monitoring programme and an operational monitoring programme. Member States may also need
                      in some cases to establish programmes of investigative monitoring.


                      Member States shall monitor parameters which are indicative of the status of each relevant quality element. In
                      selecting parameters for biological quality elements Member States shall identify the appropriate taxonomic
                      level required to achieve adequate confidence and precision in the classification of the quality elements.
                      Estimates of the level of confidence and precision of the results provided by the monitoring programmes shall
                      be given in the plan.




             1.3.1.   Design of surveillance monitoring


                      Objective


                      Member States shall establish surveillance monitoring programmes to provide information for:


                       supplementing and validating the impact assessment procedure detailed in Annex II,


                       the efficient and effective design of future monitoring programmes,


                       the assessment of long-term changes in natural conditions, and


                       the assessment of long-term changes resulting from widespread anthropogenic activity.


                      The results of such monitoring shall be reviewed and used, in combination with the impact assessment
                      procedure described in Annex II, to determine requirements for monitoring programmes in the current and
                      subsequent river basin management plans.


                      Selection of monitoring points


                      Surveillance monitoring shall be carried out of sufficient surface water bodies to provide an assessment of the
                      overall surface water status within each catchment or subcatchments within the river basin district. In selecting
                      these bodies Member States shall ensure that, where appropriate, monitoring is carried out at points where:


                       the rate of water flow is significant within the river basin district as a whole; including points on large
                        rivers where the catchment area is greater than 2 500 km2,


                       the volume of water present is significant within the river basin district, including large lakes and
                        reservoirs,


                       significant bodies of water cross a Member State boundary,


                       sites are identified under the Information Exchange Decision 77/795/EEC, and


                      at such other sites as are required to estimate the pollutant load which is transferred across Member State
                      boundaries, and which is transferred into the marine environment.

                    Selection of quality elements


                    Surveillance monitoring shall be carried out for each monitoring site for a period of one year during the
                    period covered by a river basin management plan for:


                     parameters indicative of all biological quality elements,


                     parameters indicative of all hydromorphological quality elements,

                     priority list pollutants which are discharged into the river basin or sub-basin, and


                     other pollutants discharged in significant quantities in the river basin or sub-basin,


                    unless the previous surveillance monitoring exercise showed that the body concerned reached good status
                    and there is no evidence from the review of impact of human activity in Annex II that the impacts on the
                    body have changed. In these cases, surveillance monitoring shall be carried out once every three river basin
                    management plans.




           1.3.2.   Design of operational monitoring


                    Operational monitoring shall be undertaken in order to:


                     establish the status of those bodies identified as being at risk of failing to meet their environmental
                      objectives, and


                     assess any changes in the status of such bodies resulting from the programmes of measures.


                    The programme may be amended during the period of the river basin management plan in the light of
                    information obtained as part of the requirements of Annex II or as part of this Annex, in particular to allow a
                    reduction in frequency where an impact is found not to be significant or the relevant pressure is removed.



                    Selection of monitoring sites


                    Operational monitoring shall be carried out for all those bodies of water which on the basis of either the
                    impact assessment carried out in accordance with Annex II or surveillance monitoring are identified as being
                    at risk of failing to meet their environmental objectives under Article 4 and for those bodies of water into
                    which priority list substances are discharged. Monitoring points shall be selected for priority list substances as
                    specified in the legislation laying down the relevant environmental quality standard. In all other cases,
                    including for priority list substances where no specific guidance is given in such legislation, monitoring points
                    shall be selected as follows:


                     for bodies at risk from significant point source pressures, sufficient monitoring points within each body in
                      order to assess the magnitude and impact of the point source. Where a body is subject to a number of
                      point source pressures monitoring points may be selected to assess the magnitude and impact of these
                      pressures as a whole,


                     for bodies at risk from significant diffuse source pressures, sufficient monitoring points within a selection
                      of the bodies in order to assess the magnitude and impact of the diffuse source pressures. The selection of
                      bodies shall be made such that they are representative of the relative risks of the occurrence of the diffuse
                      source pressures, and of the relative risks of the failure to achieve good surface water status,


                     for bodies at risk from significant hydromorphological pressure, sufficient monitoring points within a
                      selection of the bodies in order to assess the magnitude and impact of the hydromorphological pressures.
                      The selection of bodies shall be indicative of the overall impact of the hydromorphological pressure to
                      which all the bodies are subject.

                      Selection of quality elements



                      In order to assess the magnitude of the pressure to which bodies of surface water are subject Member States
                      shall monitor for those quality elements which are indicative of the pressures to which the body or bodies are
                      subject. In order to assess the impact of these pressures, Member States shall monitor as relevant:


                       parameters indicative of the biological quality element, or elements, most sensitive to the pressures to
                        which the water bodies are subject,


                       all priority substances discharged, and other pollutants discharged in significant quantities,


                       parameters indicative of the hydromorphological quality element most sensitive to the pressure identified.




             1.3.3.   Design of investigative monitoring



                      Objective



                      Investigative monitoring shall be carried out:


                       where the reason for any exceedances is unknown,


                       where surveillance monitoring indicates that the objectives set out in Article 4 for a body of water are not
                        likely to be achieved and operational monitoring has not already been established, in order to ascertain
                        the causes of a water body or water bodies failing to achieve the environmental objectives, or


                       to ascertain the magnitude and impacts of accidental pollution,



                      and shall inform the establishment of a programme of measures for the achievement of the environmental
                      objectives and specific measures necessary to remedy the effects of accidental pollution.




             1.3.4.   Frequency of monitoring



                      For the surveillance monitoring period, the frequencies for monitoring parameters indicative of
                      physico-chemical quality elements given below should be applied unless greater intervals would be justified on
                      the basis of technical knowledge and expert judgement. For biological or hydromorphological quality elements
                      monitoring shall be carried out at least once during the surveillance monitoring period.



                      For operational monitoring, the frequency of monitoring required for any parameter shall be determined by
                      Member States so as to provide sufficient data for a reliable assessment of the status of the relevant quality
                      element. As a guideline, monitoring should take place at intervals not exceeding those shown in the table
                      below unless greater intervals would be justified on the basis of technical knowledge and expert judgement.



                      Frequencies shall be chosen so as to achieve an acceptable level of confidence and precision. Estimates of the
                      confidence and precision attained by the monitoring system used shall be stated in the river basin management
                      plan.



                      Monitoring frequencies shall be selected which take account of the variability in parameters resulting from
                      both natural and anthropogenic conditions. The times at which monitoring is undertaken shall be selected so
                      as to minimise the impact of seasonal variation on the results, and thus ensure that the results reflect changes

                    requirements:


                    Drinking water abstraction points

                    Bodies of surface water designated in Article 7 which provide more than 100 m3 a day as an average shall be
                    designated as monitoring sites and shall be subject to such additional monitoring as may be necessary to meet
                    the requirements of that Article. Such bodies shall be monitored for all priority substances discharged and all
                    other substances discharged in significant quantities which could affect the status of the body of water and
                    which are controlled under the provisions of the Drinking Water Directive. Monitoring shall be carried out in
                    accordance with the frequencies set out below:

                      to above where, on the basis of the impact assessment and the surveillance monitoring, they are identified as
                      being at risk of failing to meet their environmental objectives under Article 4. Monitoring shall be carried out
                      to assess the magnitude and impact of all relevant significant pressures on these bodies and, where necessary,
                      to assess changes in the status of such bodies resulting from the programmes of measures. Monitoring shall
                      continue until the areas satisfy the water-related requirements of the legislation under which they are
                      designated and meet their objectives under Article 4.

           1.4.     Classification and presentation of ecological status



           1.4.1.   Comparability of biological monitoring results


                    (i)    Member States shall establish monitoring systems for the purpose of estimating the values of the
                           biological quality elements specified for each surface water category or for heavily modified and artificial
                           bodies of surface water. In applying the procedure set out below to heavily modified or artificial water
                           bodies, references to ecological status should be construed as references to ecological potential. Such
                           systems may utilise particular species or groups of species which are representative of the quality element
                           as a whole.


                    (ii)   In order to ensure comparability of such monitoring systems, the results of the systems operated by each
                           Member State shall be expressed as ecological quality ratios for the purposes of classification of
                           ecological status. These ratios shall represent the relationship between the values of the biological
                           parameters observed for a given body of surface water and the values for these parameters in the
                           reference conditions applicable to that body. The ratio shall be expressed as a numerical value between
                           zero and one, with high ecological status represented by values close to one and bad ecological status by
                           values close to zero.


                    (iii) Each Member State shall divide the ecological quality ratio scale for their monitoring system for each
                          surface water category into five classes ranging from high to bad ecological status, as defined in Section
                          1.2, by assigning a numerical value to each of the boundaries between the classes. The value for the
                          boundary between the classes of high and good status, and the value for the boundary between good and
                          moderate status shall be established through the intercalibration exercise described below.


                    (iv)   The Commission shall facilitate this intercalibration exercise in order to ensure that these class
                           boundaries are established consistent with the normative definitions in Section 1.2 and are comparable
                           between Member States.


                    (v)    As part of this exercise the Commission shall facilitate an exchange of information between Members
                           States leading to the identification of a range of sites in each ecoregion in the Community; these sites
                           will form an intercalibration network. The network shall consist of sites selected from a range of surface
                           water body types present within each ecoregion. For each surface water body type selected, the network
                           shall consist of at least two sites corresponding to the boundary between the normative definitions of
                           high and good status, and at least two sites corresponding to the boundary between the normative
                           definitions of good and moderate status. The sites shall be selected by expert judgement based on joint
                           inspections and all other available information.


                    (vi)   Each Member State monitoring system shall be applied to those sites in the intercalibration network
                           which are both in the ecoregion and of a surface water body type to which the system will be applied
                           pursuant to the requirements of this Directive. The results of this application shall be used to set the
                           numerical values for the relevant class boundaries in each Member State monitoring system.


                    (vii) Within three years of the date of entry into force of the Directive, the Commission shall prepare a draft
                          register of sites to form the intercalibration network which may be adapted in accordance with the
                          procedures laid down in Article 21. The final register of sites shall be established within four years of the
                          date of entry into force of the Directive and shall be published by the Commission.


                    (viii) The Commission and Member States shall complete the intercalibration exercise within 18 months of the
                           date on which the finalised register is published.


                    (ix)   The results of the intercalibration exercise and the values established for the Member State monitoring
                           system classifications shall be published by the Commission within six months of the completion of the
                           intercalibration exercise.

                    ecological potential


                    (i) For surface water categories, the ecological status classification for the body of water shall be represented
                        by the lower of the values for the biological and physico-chemical monitoring results for the relevant
                        quality elements classified in accordance with the first column of the table set out below. Member States

                      (ii) For heavily modified and artificial water bodies, the ecological potential classification for the body of water
                           shall be represented by the lower of the values for the biological and physico-chemical monitoring results

                      be recorded as achieving good chemical status. If not, the body shall be recorded as failing to achieve good
                      chemical status.

                    Groundwater level               The level of groundwater in the groundwater body is such that the available
                                                    groundwater resource is not exceeded by the long-term annual average rate of
                                                    abstraction.

                                                    Accordingly, the level of groundwater is not subject to anthropogenic
                                                    alterations such as would result in:

                                                    and alterations to flow direction resulting from level changes may occur
                                                    temporarily, or continuously in a spatially limited area, but such reversals do
                                                    not cause saltwater or other intrusion, and do not indicate a sustained and
                                                    clearly identified anthropogenically induced trend in flow direction likely to
                                                    result in such intrusions.

           2.2.1.   Groundwater level monitoring network

                    The groundwater monitoring network shall be established in accordance with the requirements of Articles 7
                    and 8. The monitoring network shall be designed so as to provide a reliable assessment of the quantitative
                    status of all groundwater bodies or groups of bodies including assessment of the available groundwater
                    resource. Member States shall provide a map or maps showing the groundwater monitoring network in the
                    river basin management plan.


           2.2.2.   Density of monitoring sites

                    The network shall include sufficient representative monitoring points to estimate the groundwater level in each
                    groundwater body or group of bodies taking into account short and long-term variations in recharge and in
                    particular:

                     for groundwater bodies identified as being at risk of failing to achieve environmental objectives under
                      Article 4, ensure sufficient density of monitoring points to assess the impact of abstractions and discharges
                      on the groundwater level,

                     for groundwater bodies within which groundwater flows across a Member State boundary, ensure
                      sufficient monitoring points are provided to estimate the direction and rate of groundwater flow across
                      the Member State boundary.


           2.2.3.   Monitoring frequency

                    The frequency of observations shall be sufficient to allow assessment of the quantitative status of each
                    groundwater body or group of bodies taking into account short and long-term variations in recharge. In
                    particular:

                      The results obtained from the monitoring network for a groundwater body or group of bodies shall be used to
                      assess the quantitative status of that body or those bodies. Subject to point 2.5. Member States shall provide a
                      map of the resulting assessment of groundwater quantitative status, colour-coded in accordance with the
                      following regime:

                                                        objectives specified under Article 4 for associated surface waters nor any
                                                        significant diminution of the ecological or chemical quality of such bodies
                                                        nor in any significant damage to terrestrial ecosystems which depend

             2.4.1.   Groundwater monitoring network

                      The groundwater monitoring network shall be established in accordance with the requirements of Articles 7
                      and 8. The monitoring network shall be designed so as to provide a coherent and comprehensive overview of
                      groundwater chemical status within each river basin and to detect the presence of long-term anthropogenically
                      induced upward trends in pollutants.

                    On the basis of the characterisation and impact assessment carried out in accordance with Article 5 and
                    Annex II, Member States shall for each period to which a river basin management plan applies, establish a
                    surveillance monitoring programme. The results of this programme shall be used to establish an operational
                    monitoring programme to be applied for the remaining period of the plan.


                    Estimates of the level of confidence and precision of the results provided by the monitoring programmes shall
                    be given in the plan.



           2.4.2.   Surveillance monitoring


                    Objective


                    Surveillance monitoring shall be carried out in order to:

                     supplement and validate the impact assessment procedure,

                     provide information for use in the assessment of long term trends both as a result of changes in natural
                      conditions and through anthropogenic activity.


                    Selection of monitoring sites


                    Sufficient monitoring sites shall be selected for each of the following:

                     bodies identified as being at risk following the characterisation exercise undertaken in accordance with
                      Annex II,

                     bodies which cross a Member State boundary.


                    Selection of parameters


                    The following set of core parameters shall be monitored in all the selected groundwater bodies:

                     oxygen content

                     pH value

                     conductivity

                     nitrate

                     ammonium


                    Bodies which are identified in accordance with Annex II as being at significant risk of failing to achieve good
                    status shall also be monitored for those parameters which are indicative of the impact of these pressures.


                    Transboundary water bodies shall also be monitored for those parameters which are relevant for the protection
                    of all of the uses supported by the groundwater flow.


           2.4.3.   Operational monitoring


                    Objective


                    Operational monitoring shall be undertaken in the periods between surveillance monitoring programmes in
                    order to:

                     establish the chemical status of all groundwater bodies or groups of bodies determined as being at risk,

                     establish the presence of any long term anthropogenically induced upward trend in the concentration of
                      any pollutant.

                      Selection of monitoring sites

                      Operational monitoring shall be carried out for all those groundwater bodies or groups of bodies which on the
                      basis of both the impact assessment carried out in accordance with Annex II and surveillance monitoring are
                      identified as being at risk of failing to meet objectives under Article 4. The selection of monitoring sites shall
                      also reflect an assessment of how representative monitoring data from that site is of the quality of the relevant
                      groundwater body or bodies.


                      Frequency of monitoring

                      Operational monitoring shall be carried out for the periods between surveillance monitoring programmes at a
                      frequency sufficient to detect the impacts of relevant pressures but at a minimum of once per annum.


             2.4.4.   Identification of trends in pollutants

                      Member States shall use data from both surveillance and operational monitoring in the identification of long
                      term anthropogenically induced upward trends in pollutant concentrations and the reversal of such trends. The
                      base year or period from which trend identification is to be calculated shall be identified. The calculation of
                      trends shall be undertaken for a body or, where appropriate, group of bodies of groundwater. Reversal of a
                      trend shall be demonstrated statistically and the level of confidence associated with the identification stated.

             2.4.5.   Interpretation and presentation of groundwater chemical status

                      In assessing status, the results of individual monitoring points within a groundwater body shall be aggregated
                      for the body as a whole. Without prejudice to the Directives concerned, for good status to be achieved for a
                      groundwater body, for those chemical parameters for which environmental quality standards have been set in
                      Community legislation:

                       the mean value of the results of monitoring at each point in the groundwater body or group of bodies
                        shall be calculated, and

                       in accordance with Article 17 these mean values shall be used to demonstrate compliance with good
                        groundwater chemical status.

                      Subject to point 2.5, Member States shall provide a map of groundwater chemical status, colour-coded as
                      indicated below:
                      Good:       green
                      Poor:       red

                      Member States shall also indicate by a black dot on the map, those groundwater bodies which are subject to a
                      significant and sustained upward trend in the concentrations of any pollutant resulting from the impact of
                      human activity. Reversal of a trend shall be indicated by a blue dot on the map.

                      These maps shall be included in the river basin management plan.


             2.5.     Presentation of Groundwater Status

                      Member States shall provide in the river basin management plan a map showing for each groundwater body
                      or groups of groundwater bodies both the quantitative status and the chemical status of that body or group of
                      bodies, colour-coded in accordance with the requirements of points 2.2.4 and 2.4.5. Member States may
                      choose not to provide separate maps under points 2.2.4 and 2.4.5 but shall in that case also provide an
                      indication in accordance with the requirements of point 2.4.5 on the map required under this point, of those
